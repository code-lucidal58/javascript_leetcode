n=n+1# JavaScript Leetcode
Leetcode started LC Javascript Challenge in May 2023. This is the list of all problems that were asked each day during the time.
* [Day 1](#day-1)
* [Day 2](#day-2)

## Day 1
Code: [Create Hello World Function](./create_hello_world_function.js)

### Functions
Function can be defined using the word `function`.
#### Basic Syntax
```
function f(a, b) {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}
console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
```

#### Anonymous Syntax
```
var f = function(a, b) {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}
console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
```

#### Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
```
const result = (function(a, b) {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum;
})(3, 4);
console.log(result); // 7
```

#### Functions with Functions
```
function createFunction() {
  function f(a, b) {
    const sum = a + b;
    return sum;
  }
  return f;
}
const f = createFunction();
console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
```

#### Function Hoisting
A function can be used before it is initialized. Only done when declaration of functions is with the `function` (basic) syntax. However, this is considered bad practice as it reduces readability.
```
function createFunction() {
  return f;
  function f(a, b) {
    const sum = a + b;
    return sum;
  }
}
const f = createFunction();
console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
```

#### Closures
When a function is created, it has access to a reference to all the variables declared around it (in the scope), also known as it's `lexical environment`. The combination of the function and its environment is called a `closure`.
```
function createAdder(a) {
  function f(b) {
    const sum = a + b;
    return sum;
  }
  return f;
}
const f = createAdder(3);
console.log(f(4)); // 7
```
In this example, `createAdder` passes the first parameter `a` and the inner function has access to it. This way, `createAdder` serves as a factory of new functions, each time it is called with a different value of `a`. The returned function `f` will act differently each time.

### Arrow syntax
It is a preferred way of declaring a function. These cannot be used as constructors. Calling them with `new` will throw `TypeError`. They do not support `yield`, hence cannot be generator functions.
#### Basic Syntax
```
const f = (a, b) => {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum;
};
console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
```

#### Omit Return
If function statement is very small, then `return` statement can be omitted.
```
const f = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
```

### Rest Arguments
`Spread`(...) allows an iterable to be expanded inplace.
```
function f(...args) {
  const sum = args[0] + args[1];
  return sum;
}
console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
```
This can be used to create generic function factory.
```
function log(inputFunction) {
  return function(...args) {
     console.log("Input", args);
     const result = inputFunction(...args);
     console.log("Output", result);
     return result;
  }
}
const f = log((a, b) => a + b);
f(1, 2); // Logs: Input [1, 2] Output 3
```

## Day 2
Code: [Counter](./counter.js)

Discussed earlier, a function has reference to all variables inside it and any other variable/function in its outer scope. This is called lexical environment. This promotes `encapsulation`. Each time the outer function is called, a separate copy of the function statements and variables inside it is maintained.

## Day 3
TODO

## Day 7
Code: [Function Composition](function_composition.js)

`Function composition`is a concept in functional programming where the output of one function is used as the input of another function. In other words, it's the process of chaining two or more functions together so that the result of one function becomes the input to the next.
The notation (f âˆ˜ g)(x) is used in mathematics to represent function composition. It is read as "f composed with g" or "f of g", or f(g(x)).
